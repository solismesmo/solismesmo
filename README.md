# 👋 Hello, World! 🇧🇷

I'm Lisley Costa, but you can call me just Lis. A data analysis and tech enthusiast. I currently study software engineering at 🇫🇷 [École 42](https://42.fr/) (São Paulo - SP, Brazil). </br>
With 1 year of experience in Business Inteligence, I've had the opportunity to work on some really cool projects and explore technologies.

# 🚀 Expertise

As a Data Analysis and ETL Professional, with significant skills in Qlik Sense, QlikView, SQL, and dashboard construction. With experience in data analysis and a deep understanding of Business Intelligence tools, I am confident that I can add value to the projects you are involved in.

My passion for data analysis and the ability to extract valuable insights from complex datasets have motivated me to seek challenging opportunities in this field. My experience in Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) allows me to handle large volumes of data efficiently, ensuring they are ready for in-depth analysis.

In addition to my technical skills, I am also known for my teamwork, attention to detail, and commitment to meeting deadlines. 

# 📚 Learning... 

I'm currently pursuing a dual educational journey that combines the technical world of Software Engineering at 42 with the creative realm of User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) Design at EBAC.
your project, show the current status, and document software better, together. 
At 42, I am immersing myself in the intricacies of Software Engineering, where I am developing a strong foundation in coding, problem-solving, and software development practices. This rigorous program not only equips me with technical skills, it also fuels my ability to think critically and work collaboratively on complex projects.

Simultaneously, at EBAC, I am delving into the fascinating world of UX/UI Design. Here, I am learning the art of creating user-friendly and visually appealing interfaces, ensuring that the end-users have an exceptional experience with the software and applications I design. I'm passionate about understanding user behaviors, conducting research, and crafting designs that seamlessly integrate form and function.

My dual focus on both engineering and design allows me to bridge the gap between functionality and aesthetics, striving to create software that not only works flawlessly but also delights users with its usability and visual appeal.

Thank you for taking the time to learn about my skills.
