  Hello, World!🇧🇷
</h1>

I'm Lisley Costa, but you can call me just Lis. A data analysis and tech enthusiast. I currently study software engineering at 42 in Brazil. With 1 year of experience in Business Inteligence, I've had the opportunity to work on some really cool projects and explore technologies.

# 🚀 Expertise:

As a Data Analysis and ETL Professional, with significant skills in Qlik Sense, QlikView, SQL, and dashboard construction. 
My passion for data analysis and the ability to extract valuable insights from complex datasets have motivated me to seek challenging opportunities in this field. 
In addition to my technical skills, I am also known for my teamwork, attention to detail, and commitment to meeting deadlines. 

I'm currently pursuing a dual educational journey that combines the technical world of Software Engineering at [École 42](https://42.fr/) - [Sao Paulo](https://www.42sp.org.br) with the creative realm of User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) Design at [EBAC](https://ebaconline.com.br/).

At 42, I am immersing myself in the intricacies of Software Engineering, where I am developing a strong foundation in coding, problem-solving, and software development practices. This rigorous program not only equips me with technical skills, it also fuels my ability to think critically and work collaboratively on complex projects.

Simultaneously, at EBAC, I am learning the art of creating user-friendly and visually appealing interfaces, ensuring that the end-users have an exceptional experience with the software and applications I design. I'm passionate about understanding user behaviors, conducting research, and crafting designs that seamlessly integrate form and function.
